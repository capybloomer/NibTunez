# NibTunez
NibTunez is an Open Source Playlists and Music Discovery using the last.fm API.

Developed using HTML5 & Javascript, you are currently seeing the front end for a much more ambitions project.

At this time, you can upload a song, [plug in a free last.fm API key](https://www.last.fm/api/authentication) and have it generate a playlist of similar music / export that playlist into a .txt file.  Your song / playlist is not saved server side.  The only entity that is tracking your music is last.fm by seeing your playlist via your API key (and whatever GitHub collects).

You can run this offline by just downloading the HTML file, no need for a webserver - just a modern browser.

# Demo
